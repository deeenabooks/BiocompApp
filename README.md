## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to offer a user-friendly desktop application for selecting biocompatibility tests for medical implants. The **Biocompatibility Test Selector App** streamlines the process of identifying the required tests based on an implant's specifications and intended use. It serves as a valuable tool for researchers, engineers, and medical professionals to ensure the safety and compliance of their implant designs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the **Biocompatibility Test Selector App**, you will need the following prerequisites:

- A Python development environment (IDE) installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file and extract the contents.

2. Open your Python IDE and create a new Python project or open an existing one.

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
4. Run the application by executing the main Python script.
### Usage
Upon launching the Biocompatibility Test Selector App, users can input information about their implant, such as its material, intended use, and specific characteristics. The application will provide recommendations for biocompatibility tests based on open-source documents and guidelines.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the following sources for their valuable contributions to this project:

FDA (USA) Documents: The project relies on open-source documents provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information.

ISO 10933 Series: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10933 series of standards has been instrumental in shaping the biocompatibility testing guidelines used in this project.

TUV SUD: We appreciate the resources and insights offered by TUV SUD, which have helped inform the selection criteria for biocompatibility tests.

## Disclaimer
Please note that while the Biocompatibility Test Selector App is a valuable tool for simplifying the test selection process, it does not claim to cover all possible scenarios. The information provided is based on open-source documents, and users should exercise due diligence to ensure that their specific implant project meets all necessary regulatory and safety requirements.

We welcome contributions and feedback from the biomedical engineering and medical device communities to improve this project and make it even more valuable for users. Feel free to get involved by submitting issues, suggesting enhancements, or collaborating on the development of this desktop application.
